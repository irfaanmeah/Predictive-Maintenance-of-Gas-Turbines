# Predictive Maintenance of Gas Turbines

## Problem Statement
To predict the failure of Gas turbines between 40 to 0 days of actual failure. For example, if the actual failure of turbine happens on the 1st of Dec 2020, the model should be able to predict it's failure from the 22nd of Oct 2020

## Input

A file containing the sensor measurements and settings for 10 turbines at a daily level

## Model

A simple Random forest model to check the baseline accuracy of the model

## Output

A flag which indicates the failure of the turbing within 40 days
